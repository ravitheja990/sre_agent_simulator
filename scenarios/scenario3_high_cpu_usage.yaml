summary: |
  A video streaming service deployed to GCP.
  Has a Cassandra database, a backend, and a frontend all running in a single Kubernetes cluster.
  Has a Datadog agent in the same Kubernetes cluster.
  Has a Datadog API where logs for all systems are served and queryable.
  The system has been running from date 2024-07-01 to 2024-07-10 for all services, meaning logs and metadata should be available from them.
  The backend has been experiencing frequent crashes due to high CPU usage. These issues should be shown in tool calls to the Kubernetes tools as well as Datadog logs. The logs show CPU usage spikes and out of CPU errors.
  There are no other problems in this environment.
